### Installation

1. Be sure to have SketchUp 2017 or newer.
2. Download latest Parametric Modeling plugin from the [SketchUcation PluginStore](https://sketchucation.com/plugin/2387-parametric_modeling).
3. Install plugin following this [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyM5f81eRno).

Now, you should have in SketchUp a "Parametric Modeling" menu in "Extensions" menu and a "Parametric Modeling" toolbar.

### Nodes Editor

#### Basics

Nodes Editor is the place where you can design a parametric schema. A parametric schema is made of nodes and connections between nodes. A node is made of input sockets, fields and output sockets.

To add a node: click on an icon in toolbar inside Nodes Editor window.

To move a node: drag and drop node at desired position.

To connect two nodes: click on an output socket of first node then click on an input socket of second node. Only sockets of same type are connectable. Hint: hover a socket if you are not sure about its type.
